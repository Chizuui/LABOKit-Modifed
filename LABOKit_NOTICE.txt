LABOKit – Modular Image Processing Toolkit
===============================================

Application: LABOKit
Author: Kano (IG: @kanc.hii4)
Purpose: LABOKit is a modular desktop tool for offline image processing,
         built using Python and Qt.

LABOKit Core & Plugins provide:
         - Offline background removal (rembg + U^2-Net + ONNX Runtime)
         - Offline image upscaling (Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan)
         - Plugins - Raster to Vector tracing (Quick Vector / OpenCV)
         - Plugins - Retro Dithering & Effects (Dithering FX)
         - Plugins - Batch Image Conversion & Compression

This application bundles and depends on several third-party open-source components.
