LABOKit – Background Removal & Upscaling Toolkit
===============================================

Application: LABOKit
Author: Kano (IG: @kanc.hii4)
Purpose: Desktop tool for offline image background removal and image upscaling on Windows,
         built using Python and Qt. LABOKit provides:
         - Offline background removal (rembg + U^2-Net + ONNX Runtime)
         - Offline image upscaling (Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan)

This application bundles and depends on several third-party open-source components.

7. Tooling & AI Assistance
--------------------------

Some parts of the application’s structure, code skeletons, and documentation
(including this NOTICE file) were drafted with the assistance of AI tools,
specifically:

- OpenAI’s ChatGPT (reasoning models)
- Google's Gemini

All outputs were reviewed, adapted, refined, and finalized by the author.
All responsibility for the final source code, packaging, and distribution of
LABOKit lies with the author (Kano).


8. General Notes
----------------

- LABOKit does not provide or claim ownership of the machine learning models
  or algorithms used by rembg / U^2-Net / ONNX Runtime / Real-ESRGAN /
  Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan. These remain the property of their respective
  authors and organizations.

- This application bundles those components to provide an offline background
  removal and image upscaling workflow. Users are responsible for ensuring
  their own compliance with the license terms of each third-party component,
  especially for commercial or redistributed use.

- For full legal terms, always refer to the official license files and
  documentation of each project.
