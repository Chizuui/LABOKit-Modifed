## 📥 Download (Portable Version)

1.  Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/wagakano/LABOKit/releases)** page.
2.  Download the `LABOKit_v1.2.zip` (or latest version).
3.  Extract the zip file.
4.  Run `LABOKit.exe`.

> **Note:** The portable version is larger in size because it bundles the Python engine and necessary libraries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Windows (Recommended)
* **Vulkan-compatible GPU** (Required for the Upscaler feature)

### Setup
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/wagakano/LABOKit.git](https://github.com/wagakano/LABOKit.git)
    cd LABOKit
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Model Setup (Important)**
    
    * **Background Removal (`rembg`):**
        * **Automatic:** The application will automatically download the required model (`u2net.onnx`, ~170MB) into the `models/` folder on the first run.
        * **Manual (Offline):** If you prefer manual setup, download [u2net.onnx](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2net.onnx), create a folder named `models` in the project root, and place the file there (`LABOKit/models/u2net.onnx`).

    * **Upscaler (`Real-ESRGAN`):**
        * Download `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan.exe` and the models (e.g., `realesrgan-x4plus.bin`, etc.).
        * Place them in the `realesrgan/` folder inside the project directory.
        * *(Note: Ensure the executable path matches the setup in `main.py`)*

4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Use
